Skater: This project is the first python project that I worked on for my CPE 101 - Introduction to Computer Science class,
this implemented a program that would prompt the user for its weight, distance an object will be thrown, and the object that
they will throw. After doing some calculations the program will print a message depending on the object they threw and the
velocity they threw it at.

Skills Used:
- I was able to implement correct use of input and output in python
- I got associated with Unit testing in python
- I learned how to import other python files from the same folder and structure my methods better for a better code style
